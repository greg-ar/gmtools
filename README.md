# Greg's GM Tools
One day I will think of a better name until then, well here is my "passion project" 

Like many nerds/geeks in this space, I play ttrpgs. DnD, Pathfinder etc. And DM/GM most of them.

I was never satisfied with any of the other DM/GM tools I found. That doesn't mean
they are bad, just didn't fit my personal style of play. 

And I figured, "I will do it myself".
